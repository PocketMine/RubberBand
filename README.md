__A multithreaded frontend proxy with multiple servers, lobbies and load balancing. For PocketMine-MP__


### Features

* Multiple frontend threads.
* One thread per server.
* Assign each server to a group to load balance between them, for example, multiple lobbies so you can always accept new players.
* Seamless server-to-server transfer.
* Proxy only needs a single config, an API key. Everything else is done by the servers.
* Servers only need a plugin, no source changes. Also, it includes an API to extend its functionality.
* Servers get autoregistered, so they can start accepting players directly.
* Global / per server player list accesible.
